    "- Classify imminent failures before they occur\n",
    "- Enable proactive maintenance scheduling\n",
    "- Reduce unplanned downtime and maintenance costs\n",

    "### Success Criteria\n",
    "- **RUL Prediction**: RMSE < 15 time units, RÂ² > 0.7\n",
    "- **Failure Classification**: F1-score > 0.75, Recall > 0.80 (minimize false negatives)\n",
